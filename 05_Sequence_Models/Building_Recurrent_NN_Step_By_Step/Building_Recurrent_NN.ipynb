    "# Building Recurrent Neural Network - Step by Step\n",

    "Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) are very effective for Natural Language Processing and other sequence tasks because they have \"memory\". They can read inputs $x^{\\langle t \\rangle}$ (such as words) one at a time, and remember some information/context through the hidden layer activations that get passed from one time-step to the next. This allows a unidirectional RNN to take information from the past to process later inputs. A bidirectional RNN can take context from both the past and the future. \n",

    "- Superscript $\\langle t \\rangle$ denotes an object at the $t^{th}$ time-step. \n",
